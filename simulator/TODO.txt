To Do:

- Fixes for flags in ADC/SBC/CMP
- Get BASIC fully working
- Implement more instructions
- Support for lower case chars and make caps lock a toggle
- Test with other programs: JMON, CEGMON, Enhanced Basic

Future:

- Make debug output optional
- Command line options to load file(s), start at address, control trace output
- Main program with command line/debug interface: load, run, reset,
  step, show registers, dump, breakpoints, watchpoints, edit memory,
  registers, disassemble, IRQ, NMI, save memory, show video screen
- Qt-based GUI
- Add support for multiple RAM ranges?
- Simulate OSI 6850 UART serial port for LOAD/SAVE
- Simulated Sound/Bank/Color/Video register
- Simulate BRK
- Simulate IRQ and NMI
- Option for Rockwell instructions
- Option for 65C02 instructions
- Option for 65816 instructions
- Support loading RAM or ROM from other file formats (S record file, Intel hex, etc.)
- Only read/write effective addresses once
- Breakpoint function
- Disassembler
- Simulate 610 board: additional RAM, Second 6550 UART, 6820 PIA, floppy disk
- Optimize performance
- Handle decimal mode
