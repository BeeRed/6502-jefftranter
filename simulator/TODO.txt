Known Bugs:

- Some math results are incorrect
- Extra newline in output

To Do:

- Test with other programs: CEGMON, Enhanced Basic
- Implement more instructions
- Command line options to load file(s), start at address, control trace output
- Support for lower case chars and make caps lock a toggle
- Main program with command line/debug interface: load, run, reset,
  step, show registers, dump, breakpoints, watchpoints, edit memory,
  registers, disassemble, IRQ, NMI, save memory, show video screen
- Make debug output optional
- Qt-based GUI
- Add support for multiple RAM ranges?
- Simulate OSI 6850 UART serial port for LOAD/SAVE
- Simulated Sound/Bank/Color/Video register
- Simulate BRK
- Simulate IRQ and NMI
- Option for Rockwell instructions
- Option for 65C02 instructions
- Option for 65816 instructions
- Support loading RAM or ROM from other file formats (S record file, Intel hex, etc.)
- Only read/write effective addresses once
- Disassembler
- Simulate 610 board: additional RAM, Second 6550 UART, 6820 PIA, floppy disk
- Optimize performance
- Handle decimal mode

Command Line Options (proposed)
-------------------------------

-h --help            Show command line usage
-l <file> <address>  Load raw file in memory
-r <address>         Run from address immediately on startup, do not enter CLI
-v                   Show software version and copyright
-R                   Reset on startup
-l +/-<category>     Enable/disable logging of a category, e.g. registers instructions, video


Command Line Interface (proposed)

ASSEMBLER: A
BREAKPOINT: B <N> <ADDRESS>

Set up to 4 breakpoints, numbered 0 through 3.
"B ?" lists status of all breakpoints.
"B <n> <address>" sets breakpoint number <n> at address <address>
"B <n> 0000" removes breakpoint <n>.
Breakpoint number <n> is 0 through 3.
