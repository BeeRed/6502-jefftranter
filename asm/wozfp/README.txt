This directory contains a port of some floating point routines for the
6502 to the Replica 1 and CC65 assembler. The code was published in
Dr. Dobb's Journal, August 1976, pages 17-19. It includes the fixes
described in the errata published in Dr. Dobb's Journal,
November/December 1976, page 57.

The original code was downloaded from http://6502.org/source/

It also contains code for converting between ASCII and floating point
representations. This was taken from two articles: "A BCD to
Floating-Point Binary Routine" by Marvin L. De Jong, Compute! Issue 9,
February 1981, page 46 and "A Floating-Point Binary to BCD Routine" by
Marvin L. De Jong, Compute! Issue 11, April 1981, Page 66.

The versions in the orig directory should match the code in the
original magazine articles. The original listings had many errors
(e.g. "#" missing) and I have partially debugged the code but it is
not yet working for me on the Replica 1.
