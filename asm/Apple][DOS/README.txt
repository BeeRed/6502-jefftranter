The disk operating system for the Apple ][ was recently open sourced.
See http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/apple-ii-dos-source-code/

For fun I tried to get it to build using the CC65 assembler. Since I
do not own an Apple ][ I am not able to test it. but the files
assemble and appear to be correct.

Files:

apple_dos_rw.s          Port of low-level read/write routines (original filename Apple_DOS_RW_30May1978.txt)
Makefile                Make file for building on Linux.
