This is a port of Enhanced BASIC 2.22 for the Replica 1.
The original code is at http://mycorner.no-ip.org/6502/ehbasic/index.html

It was built with the cc65 assembler.

To build it:
- unzip the source, i.e. "unzip source.zip"
- apply the patches, i.e. "patch -p1 < REPLICA1.patch"
- build using the provided makefile, i.e. "make"

A prebuilt Woz monitor binary file is provided.
The start address is $7825.

If you want to run it on a system that doesn't support displaying
lowercase characters, such as an Apple 1, Mimeo or Obtronix, there is
an additional patch that will convert all the displayed strings to
uppercase. Apply the patch UPPERCASE.patch (in addition to the other
patch). I've provided a binary with this patch applied in the file
basic-uppercase.mon.

Known issues:

IRQ and NMI handling is not implemented because the vectors are in the
Woz monitor ROM and cannot be changed.

SAVE and LOAD commands do nothing.
