This is a port of Enhanced BASIC 2.22 for the Replica 1.
The original code is at http://mycorner.no-ip.org/6502/ehbasic/index.html

It was built with the cc65 assembler.

To build it:
- unzip the source, i.e. "unzip source.zip"
- apply the patches, i.e. "patch -p1 < REPLICA1.patch"
- build using the provided makefile, i.e. "make"

A prebuilt Woz monitor binary file is provided.
The start address is $7825.

Known issues:

IRQ and NMI handling is not implemented because the vectors are in the
Woz monitor ROM and cannot be changed.

SAVE and LOAD commands do nothing.
