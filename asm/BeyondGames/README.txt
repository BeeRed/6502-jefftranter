This is the code from the book "Beyond Games: Systems and Software for
your 6502 Personal Computer" by Ken Skier.

The same software, with some changes, was also published in the book
"Top Down Assembly Language Programming for your VIC-20 and Commodore
64", by the same author.

I do not own a copy, but the book "Top-Down Assembly Language
Programming for the 6502 Personal Computer" may also contain the same
or similar programs.

The .bas files are BASIC programs that can be used to load the
programs into memory, using OBJECTCODELOADER.bas.

The .s files are assembler source. They are intended to be assembled
with CC65 (See http://www.cc65.org).

This only includes the version for the Ohio Scientific C-1P (support
for the PET 2001, Apple II, and Atari 800 would only require entering
the appropriate system data blocks).

These files have not yet been tested.
