These is source code for the programs from the book "Programming A
MicroComputer: 6502" by Caxton C.Foster.

The source code is intended to be assembled using the CC65 tools
(http://www.cc65.org/).

It also uses the SRecord tool from http://srecord.sourceforge.net/
to produce paper tape files in MOS Technology format.

Almost all of the programs have been tested on a KIM-1 computer, but
there may have been errors introduced when entering them. I would
appreciate any feedback on errors or other issues.
