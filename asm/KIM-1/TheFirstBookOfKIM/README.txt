These are source code and text for programs from "The First Book of
KIM" by Jim Butterfield, Stan Ockers, and Eric Rehnke.

The source code is intended to be assembled using the CC65 tools
(http://www.cc65.org/).

Almost all of the programs have been tested in a KIM-1 computer, but
there may have been be errors introduced when entering them. I would
appreciate any feedback on errors or other issues.
