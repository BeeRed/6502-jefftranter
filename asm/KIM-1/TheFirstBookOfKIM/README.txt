These are source code and text for programs from "The First Book of
KIM" by Jim Butterfield, Stan Ockers, and Eric Rehnke.

This book is out of print but is availale from soures such as eBay and
scanned versions can be found on the Internet.

The source code is intended to be assembled using the CC65 tools
(http://www.cc65.org/).

Almost all of the programs have been tested on a KIM-1 computer, but
there may have been errors introduced when entering them. I would
appreciate any feedback on errors or other issues.

I have included any corrections listed in later versions of the book,
where I was aware of them.
