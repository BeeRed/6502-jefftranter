This is a port of 2KSA, the 2K Symbolic Assembler, by Robert Denison.

The source was taken from the original document (included here as a
PDF file) and modified to assemble with the CC65 assembler
tools. Because the code was modified it is not able to assemble
itself, due to the different assembler syntax.

The code can be conditionally assembled to produce the original KIM-1
version as well as a port to the Apple 1/Replica 1 (in progress).

I found a number of errors in the documentation but was able to
resolve them by looking at the assembly listing and binary dump. I
have not tested it on a KIM-1 as I do not have one.
