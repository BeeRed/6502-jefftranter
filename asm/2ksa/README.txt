This is a port of 2KSA, the 2K Symbolic Assembler.

The source was taken from the original document (included here as a
PDF) and modified to assemble with the CC65 assembler tools. Because
the code was modified it is not able to assemble itself, due to the
different assembler syntax.

The code can be assembled to produce the original KIM-1 version as
well as a port to the Apple 1/Replica 1 (in progress).
