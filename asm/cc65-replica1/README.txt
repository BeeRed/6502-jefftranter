These are patches for the CC65 assembler/C compiler tools to add
support for the Briel Replica 1 computer. The patches apply to the
latest version of cc65 and are periodically updated.

Apply the patch to the cc65 source and then build it as normal or use
the "build" script with suitable changes for your system.

It adds a new target called "replica1". See the files in the example
folder for some examples of how to build and run a C program.
